Sub: Appreciation for your Enlightment
Respected Sir,
	Thank you for your works on C codes on Galois Fields. I was trying to create variations of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and have written codes for needed operations. But I came to know other operations in GF from your awesome codes (http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/CS-07-593/).
Thank You again for enlighting us.
